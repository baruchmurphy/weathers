This project uses react typescript and the open weather API to show local weather data as well as a 7 day forcast and an interactive line graph to show how the weather will change in during the day
Although the location of the weather report is currently hard-coded, it includes code that allows for integration with the google locator API, however it requires a paid subscription to do so
